<p>A number of people wrote me about my "<a href="http://blog.precipice.org/why-wesabe-lost-to-mint" style="color: #2a5db0;">Why Wesabe Lost to Mint</a>" post to ask about this line: "...nor do I agree with those who obsess over failures for years after (as I have done in the past)." A few said they were currently agonizing over a past failure and asked how I had gotten out of that state. Here's what I wrote to one of them:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;"> </span></p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Sorry to hear about all this. I would suggest working with people you like and who encourage you, even if not on a startup project, and doing some small form of "shipping" that could lead to positive feedback.</div>
<p />
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">After the last failure, when I was in the same mode you're describing, I took a job at O'Reilly Media. Tim O'Reilly has always been extremely encouraging of me and many of the other people at O'Reilly are similarly encouraging. During that time a did a lot of speaking at O'Reilly conferences and wrote quite a bit for <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #2a5db0;">http://radar.oreilly.com/</a>. Both of those things got me some positive feedback, and with the encouragement of the people around me I was able to start making progress on what became Wesabe. Positive feedback snowballed for me, and pushed me out of my funk.</div>
<p />
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">I've always found that shipping something, anything, is the biggest help. Even just shipping a blog post.</div>
<p />
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Hope this helps and good luck.</div>
<p>For whatever reason, I haven't ever gotten to that state of obsessing over Wesabe's failures. I mostly just moved on and started thinking about what I wanted to take away from the experience (positive and negative) and what I want to do next. Maybe now I have confidence that shipping something new will work.</p>
<p>Thanks, by the way, to everyone who responded to that last post. I was overwhelmed by the response and I'm glad if it helped others.</p>
