<p>Posterous blogs come with two big smears of Facebook poop on them: the Facebook "Like" button, and a checkbox above the comments box that reads, "Post comment to Facebook."  It wasn't immediately obvious how to get rid of those, and, tinfoil-hat-clubbing though this may be, I wasn't going to use Posterous if those were required.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they're not.  Here's how to get rid of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Settings -&gt; Look and Feel -&gt; Theme and customize my site -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Enable advanced theming -&gt; Blog homepage</li>
<li>Delete: <code>&lt;fb:like href="{Permalink}" layout="button_count"&gt;&lt;/fb:like&gt;</code> </li>
<li>Now go to "Blog post" (one of the bottom tabs, like "Blog homepage") and delete the same code.</li>
<li>Next, Settings -&gt; Posting and Comments -&gt; Who should be allowed to comment on your site? -&gt; Disable all comments </li>
</ol>
<p>Disabling comments is the only way I've found to get rid of the "Post comment to Facebook" checkbox, but maybe you <a href="http://www.marco.org/705431581">don't want comments anyway</a> -- I'm fine not having them.</p>
<ol> </ol>
<p>There, your Posterous is deFaced. So much better.</p>
<p>-M</p>
